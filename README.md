# THEME-PARK-PROBLEM-USING-PRIMS-ALGORITHM-ALONG-WITH-MEMORY-AND-SPACE-PROFILING

Providing accurate and shortest distance is the main aim of the any park that u build in order to reach
different destination such as playing arena, walking area etc. We need to keep track on the memory
and space profiling as well in order to check consistency. The main aim of this project is its provides
shortest distance using prims algorithm and keep tracks on the memory and space profiling.

Using multithreading concepts, we are running the spanning tree algorithm as well as CPU profiling
algorithm at the same time. This ensures real time profiling of resource utilization by the algorithm.

Our analysis also showed that increase in number of edges and paths increases the complexity of the
problem that the algorithm has to deal with and hence the utilization of resources increases which is
evident from the change in scatter plot.

# 1.1 About The Problem
Providing the shortest path to the theme park that manager is building in order to destination
at accurate and easiest way. Memory profiling enables you to understand the memory
allocation and garbage collection behavior of your applications over time. It helps you identify
method calls in the context within which most memory was allocated and combine this
information with the number of allocated objects. The Survivor perspective helps you to
understand the context within which your long-living objects (objects that survive multiple
garbage collection cycles) are created.

# 1.2 About The Technique
This project makes use of greedy method and prims algorithm in order to find the shortest
path.

## Greedy Method
Greedy algorithms build a solution part by part, choosing the next part in such a way, that it
gives an immediate benefit. This approach never reconsiders the choices taken previously.
This approach is mainly used to solve optimization problems. Greedy method is easy to
implement and quite efficient in most cases. Hence, we can say that Greedy algorithm is an
algorithmic paradigm based on heuristic that follows local optimal choice at each step with
the hope of finding global optimal solution.

## Prims Algorithm

Is a greedy algorithm that is used to find the minimum spanning tree from a graph. Prim's
algorithm finds the sub set of edges that includes every vertex of the graph such that the sum
weights of the edges can be minimized. Primâ€™s algorithm starts with single node and
 explores all the adjacent nodes with all the connecting edge at every step.
